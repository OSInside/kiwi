# For image tests with an extra boot partition the

# layout of the kernel which breaks every image with
# an extra boot partition

# All of the following is more than a hack and I
# don't like it all

# Complains and discussions about this please with
# the SUSE kernel team as we in kiwi can just live
# with the consequences of this change
