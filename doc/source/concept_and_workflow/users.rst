Adding Users
============

User accounts can be added or modified via the `users` element, which
supports a list of multiple `user` child elements:

.. code:: xml

   <image schemaversion="{schema_version}" name="{exc_image_base_name}">
       <users>
           <user
               password="this_is_soo_insecure"
               home="/home/me" name="me"
               groups="users" pwdformat="plain"
           />
           <user
               password="$1$wYJUgpM5$RXMMeASDc035eX.NbYWFl0"
               home="/root" name="root" groups="root"
           />
       </users>
   </image>

Each `user` element represents a specific user that is added or
modified. The following attributes are mandatory:

- `name`: the UNIX username

- `home`: the path to the user's home directory

Additionally, the following optional attributes can be specified:

- `groups`: A comma separated list of UNIX groups. The first element of the
  list is used as the user's primary group. The remaining elements are
  appended to the user's supplementary groups. When no groups are assigned
  then the system's default primary group will be used.

- `id`: The numeric user id of this account.

- `pwdformat`: The format in which `password` is provided, either `plain`
  or `encrypted` (the latter is the default).

- `password`: The password for this user account. It can be provided either
  in cleartext form (`pwdformat="plain"`) or in `crypt`'ed form
  (`pwdformat="encrypted"`). Plain passwords are discouraged, as everyone
  with access to the image description would know the password. It is
  recommended to generate a hash of your password using `openssl` as
  follows:

  .. code:: bash

     $ openssl passwd -1 -salt 'xyz' YOUR_PASSWORD
