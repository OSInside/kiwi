User Defined Scripts
====================

.. note:: **Abstract**

   This chapter describes the purpose of the user defined scripts
   :file:`config.sh`, :file:`image.sh`, :file:`pre_disk_sync.sh`
   and :file:`disk.sh`, which can be used to further customize an
   image in ways that are not possible via the image description
   alone.

{kiwi} supports the following optional scripts that it runs in a
root environment (chroot) containing your new appliance:

post_bootstrap.sh
  runs at the end of the `bootstrap` phase as part of the
  :ref:`prepare step <prepare-step>`. The script can be used to
  configure the package manager with additional settings that
  should apply in the following chroot based installation step
  which completes the installation. The script is not dedicated to
  this use and can also be used for other tasks.

config.sh
  runs at the end of the :ref:`prepare step <prepare-step>`
  and after users have been set and the *overlay tree directory*
  has been applied. It is usually used to apply a permanent and final
  change of data in the root tree, such as modifying a package provided
  config file.

config-overlay.sh
  Available only if `delta_root="true"` is set. In this case the
  script runs at the end of the :ref:`prepare step <prepare-step>`
  prior the umount of the overlay root tree. It runs after an
  eventually given `config.sh` and is the last entry point to
  change the delta root tree.

images.sh
  is executed at the beginning of the :ref:`image
  creation process <create-step>`. It runs in the same image root tree
  that has been created by the prepare step but is invoked any
  time an image should be created from that root tree. It is usually
  used to apply image type specific changes to the root tree such as
  a modification to a config file that should be done when building
  a live iso but not when building a virtual disk image.

pre_disk_sync.sh
  is executed for the disk image type `oem` only and runs
  right before the synchronization of the root tree into the disk image
  loop file. The :file:`pre_disk_sync.sh` can be used to change
  content of the root tree as a last action before the sync to
  the disk image is performed. This is useful for example to delete
  components from the system which were needed before or cannot
  be modified afterwards when syncing into a read-only filesystem.

disk.sh
  is executed for the disk image type `oem` only and runs after the
  synchronization of the root tree into the disk image loop file.
  The chroot environment for this script call is the virtual disk itself
  and not the root tree as with :file:`config.sh` and :file:`images.sh`.
  The script :file:`disk.sh` is usually used to apply changes at parts of
  the system that are not an element of the file based root tree such as
  the partition table, the contents of the final initrd, the bootloader,
  filesystem attributes and more.

{kiwi} executes scripts via the operating system if their executable
bit is set (in that case a shebang is mandatory) otherwise they will be
invoked via the BASH. If a script exits with a non-zero exit code
then {kiwi} will report the failure and abort the image creation.

Developing/Debugging Scripts
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When creating a custom script it usually takes some iterations of
try and testing until a final stable state is reached. To support
developers with this task {kiwi} calls scripts associated with a
`screen` session. The connection to `screen` is only done if {kiwi}
is called with the `--debug` option.

In this mode a script can start like the following template:

.. code:: bash

   # The magic bits are still not set

   echo "break"
   /bin/bash

At call time of the script a `screen` session executes and you get
access to the break in shell. From this environment the needed script
code can be implemented. Once the shell is closed the {kiwi} process
continues.

Apart from providing a full featured terminal throughout the
execution of the script code, there is also the advantage to
have control on the session during the process of the image
creation. Listing the active sessions for script execution
can be done as follows:

.. code:: bash

   $ sudo screen -list

   There is a screen on:
        19699.pts-4.asterix     (Attached)
   1 Socket in /run/screens/S-root.

.. note::

   As shown above the screen session(s) to execute script code
   provides extended control which could also be considered a
   security risk. Because of that {kiwi} only runs scripts through
   `screen` when explicitly enabled via the `--debug` switch.
   For production processes all scripts should run in their
   native way and should not require a terminal to operate
   correctly !

Script Template for config.sh / images.sh
-----------------------------------------

{kiwi} provides a collection of methods and variables that supports users
with custom operations. For details see :ref:`image-customization-methods`.
The following template shows how to import this information in your
script:

.. code:: bash

   #======================================
   # Include functions & variables
   #--------------------------------------
   test -f /.kconfig && . /.kconfig
   test -f /.profile && . /.profile

   ...

.. warning:: Modifications of the unpacked root tree

   Keep in mind that there is only one unpacked root tree the
   script operates in. This means that all changes are permanent
   and will not be automatically restored!

Functions and Variables Provided by {kiwi}
-------------------------------------------

{kiwi} creates the :file:`.kconfig` and :file:`.profile` files to be sourced
by the shell scripts :file:`config.sh` and :file:`images.sh`.
:file:`.kconfig` contains various helper functions which can be used to
simplify the image configuration and :file:`.profile` contains environment
variables which get populated from the settings provided in the image
description.

Functions
^^^^^^^^^

The :file:`.kconfig` file provides a common set of functions.  Functions
specific to SUSE Linux Enterprise and openSUSE begin with the name
``suse``, functions applicable to all Linux distributions start with the
name ``base``.

The following list describes all functions provided by :file:`.kconfig`:

baseSetRunlevel {value}
  Set the default run level.

baseStripAndKeep {list of info-files to keep}
  Helper function for the ``baseStrip*`` functions, reads the list of files
  to check from stdin for removing
  params: files which should be kept

baseStripLocales {list of locales}
  Remove all locales, except for the ones given as the parameter.

baseStripTranslations {list of translations}
  Remove all translations, except for the ones given as the parameter.

baseStripUnusedLibs
  Remove libraries which are not directly linked against applications
  in the bin directories.

baseUpdateSysConfig {filename} {variable} {value}
  Update the contents of a sysconfig variable

baseSystemdServiceInstalled {service}
  Prints the path of the first found systemd unit or mount with name passed
  as the first parameter.

baseSysVServiceInstalled {service}
  Prints the name `${service}` if a SysV init service with that name is
  found, otherwise it prints nothing.

baseSystemdCall {service_name} {args}
  Calls `systemctl ${args} ${service_name}` if a systemd unit, a systemd
  mount or a SysV init service with the `${service_name}` exist.

baseInsertService {servicename}
  Activate the given service via :command:`systemctl`.

baseRemoveService {servicename}
  Deactivate the given service via :command:`systemctl`.

baseService {servicename} {on|off}
  Activate or deactivate a service via :command:`systemctl`.
  The function requires the service name and the value ``on`` or ``off`` as
  parameters.

  Example to enable the sshd service on boot:

  .. code:: bash

     baseService sshd on

suseInsertService {servicename}
  Calls baseInsertService and exists only for
  compatibility reasons.

suseRemoveService {servicename}
  Calls baseRemoveService and exists only for
  compatibility reasons.

suseService {servicename} {on|off}
  Calls baseService and exists only for compatibility
  reasons.

suseSetupProduct
  Creates the :file:`/etc/products.d/baseproduct` link
  pointing to the product referenced by either :file:`/etc/SuSE-brand` or
  :file:`/etc/os-release` or the latest `.prod` file available in
  :file:`/etc/products.d`

baseVagrantSetup
  Configures the image to work as a vagrant box by performing the following
  changes:

  - add the ``vagrant`` user to :file:`/etc/sudoers`
    or :file:`/etc/sudoers.d/vagrant`
  - insert the insecure vagrant ssh key, apply recommended
    ssh settings and start the ssh daemon
  - create the default shared folder :file:`/vagrant`

Debug {message}
  Helper function to print the supplied message if the variable DEBUG is
  set to 1 (it is off by default).

Echo {echo commandline}
  Helper function to print a message to the controlling terminal.

Rm {list of files}
  Helper function to delete files and log the deletion.

Profile Environment Variables
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The :file:`.profile` environment file is created by {kiwi} and contains a
specific set of variables which are listed below.

$kiwi_compressed
  The value of the `compressed` attribute set in the `type` element in
  :file:`config.xml`.

$kiwi_delete
  A list of all packages which are children of the `packages` element
  with `type="delete"` in :file:`config.xml`.

$kiwi_drivers
  A comma separated list of the driver entries as listed in the
  `drivers` section of the :file:`config.xml`.

$kiwi_iname
  The name of the image as listed in :file:`config.xml`.

$kiwi_iversion
  The image version as a string.

$kiwi_keytable
  The contents of the keytable setup as done in :file:`config.xml`.

$kiwi_language
  The contents of the locale setup as done in :file:`config.xml`.

$kiwi_profiles
  A comma separated list of profiles used to build this image.

$kiwi_timezone
  The contents of the timezone setup as done in :file:`config.xml`.

$kiwi_type
  The image type as extracted from the `type` element in
  :file:`config.xml`.


Configuration Tips
------------------

#. **Locale configuration:**

   KIWI in order to set the locale relies on :command:`systemd-firstboot`,
   which in turn writes the locale configuration file :file:`/etc/locale.conf`.
   The values for the locale settings are taken from the description XML
   file in the `<locale>` element under `<preferences>`.

   KIWI assumes systemd adoption to handle these locale settings, in case the
   build distribution does not honor `/etc/locale.conf` this is likely to not
   produce any effect on the locale settings. As an example, in SLE12
   distribution the locale configuration is already possible by using the
   systemd toolchain, however this approach overlaps with SUSE specific
   managers such as YaST. In that case using :command:`systemd-firstboot`
   is only effective if locales in :file:`/etc/sysconfig/language` are
   not set or if the file does not exist at all. In SLE12
   :file:`/etc/sysconfig/language` has precendence over
   :file:`/etc/locale.conf` for compatibility reasons and management tools
   could still relay on `sysconfig` files for locale settings.

   In any case the configuration is still possible in KIWI by using
   any distribution specific way to configure the locale setting inside the
   :file:`config.sh` script or by adding any additional configuration file
   as part of the overlay root-tree.

#. **Stateless systemd UUIDs:**

   Machine ID files (:file:`/etc/machine-id`, :file:`/var/lib/dbus/machine-id`)
   may be created and set during the image package installation depending on
   the distribution. Those UUIDs are intended to be unique and set only once
   in each deployment.

   If :file:`/etc/machine-id` does not exist or contains the string
   `uninitialized` (systemd v249 and later), this triggers firstboot behaviour
   in systemd and services using `ConditionFirstBoot=yes` will run. Unless the
   file already contains a valid machine ID, systemd will generate one and
   write it into the file, creating it if necessary. See the `machine-id man
   page <https://www.freedesktop.org/software/systemd/man/machine-id.html>`_
   for more details.

   Depending on whether firstboot behaviour should be triggered or not,
   :file:`/etc/machine-id` can be created, removed or filled with
   `uninitialized` by :file:`config.sh`.

   To prevent that images include a generated machine ID, KIWI will clear
   :file:`/etc/machine-id` if it exists and does not contain the string
   `uninitialized`. This only applies to images based on a dracut initrd, it
   does not apply for container images.

   .. note:: `rw` might be necessary if :file:`/etc/machine-id` does not exist

      For systemd to be able to write :file:`/etc/machine-id` on boot,
      it must either exist already (so that a bind mount can be created) or
      :file:`/etc` must be writable.

      By default, the root filesystem is mounted read-only by dracut/systemd,
      thus a missing :file:`/etc/machine-id` will result in an error on boot.
      The `rw` option can be added to the kernel commandline to force the
      initial mount to be read-write.

   .. note:: Avoid inconsistent :file:`/var/lib/dbus/machine-id`

      Note that :file:`/etc/machine-id` and :file:`/var/lib/dbus/machine-id`
      **must** contain the same unique ID. On modern systems
      :file:`/var/lib/dbus/machine-id` is already a symlink to
      :file:`/etc/machine-id`. However on older systems those might be two
      different files. This is the case for SLE-12 based images. If you are
      targeting these older operating systems, it is recommended to add the
      symlink creation into :file:`config.sh`:

      .. code:: bash

         #======================================
         # Make machine-id consistent with dbus
         #--------------------------------------
         if [ -e /var/lib/dbus/machine-id ]; then
             rm /var/lib/dbus/machine-id
         fi
         ln -s /etc/machine-id /var/lib/dbus/machine-id
