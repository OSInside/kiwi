Setting up Repositories
=======================

A crucial part of each appliance is the repository
selection. {kiwi} allows the end user to completely customize the selection
of repositories and packages via the `repository` element.

Adding repositories
-------------------

{kiwi} installs packages into your appliance from the repositories defined in
the image description. Therefore at least one repository **must** be
defined, as {kiwi} will otherwise not be able to fetch any packages.

A repository is added to the description via the `repository` element,
which is a child of the top-level `image` element:

.. code:: xml

   <image schemaversion="{schema_version}" name="{exc_image_base_name}">
       <!-- snip -->
       <repository type="rpm-md" alias="kiwi" priority="1">
           <source path="{exc_kiwi_repo}"/>
       </repository>
       <repository type="rpm-md" alias="OS" imageinclude="true">
           <source path="{exc_repo}"/>
       </repository>
   </image>

In the above snippet we defined two repositories:

1. The repository belonging to the {kiwi} project:
   *{exc_kiwi_repo}* at the Open Build Service (OBS)

2. The RPM repository belonging to the OS project:
   *{exc_repo}*, at the Open Build Service (OBS). The translated
   http URL will also be included in the final appliance.

The `repository` element accepts one `source` child element, which
contains the URL to the repository in an appropriate format and the
following optional attributes:

- `imageinclude`: Specify whether this repository should be added to the
  resulting image, defaults to false.

- `imageonly`: A repository with `imageonly="true"` will not be available
  during image build, but only in the resulting appliance. Defaults to
  false.

- `priority`: An integer priority for all packages in this repository. If
  the same package is available in more than one repository, then the one
  with the highest priority is used.

- `alias`: Name to be used for this repository, it will appear as the
  repository's name in the image, which is visible via ``zypper repos`` or
  ``dnf repolist``. {kiwi} will construct an alias from the path in the
  `source` child element (replacing each `/` with a `_`), if no value is
  given.

- `repository_gpgcheck`: Specify whether or not this specific repository is
  configured to to run repository signature validation. If not set, the
  package manager's default is used.

- `package_gpgcheck`: Boolean value that specifies whether each package's
  GPG signature will be verified. If omitted, the package manager's default
  will be used

- `components`: Distribution components used for `deb` repositories,
  defaults to `main`.

- `distribution`: Distribution name information, used for deb repositories.

- `profiles`: List of profiles to which this repository applies.

.. _supported-repository-paths:

Supported repository paths
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The actual location of a repository is specified in the `source` child
element of `repository` via its only attribute `path`. {kiwi} supports the
following paths types:

- `http://URL` or `https://URL` or `ftp://URL`: a URL to the repository
  available via HTTP(s) or FTP.

- `obs://$PROJECT/$REPOSITORY`: evaluates to the repository `$REPOSITORY`
  of the project `$PROJECT` available on the Open Build Service (OBS). By
  default {kiwi} will look for projects on `build.opensuse.org
  <https://build.opensuse.org>`_, but this can be overridden using the
  runtime configuration file (see :ref:`runtime_config`).
  Note that it is not possible to add repositories using the `obs://` path
  from **different** OBS instances (use direct URLs to the :file:`.repo`
  file instead in this case).

- `obsrepositories:/`: special path only available for builds using the
  Open Build Service. The repositories configured for the OBS project in
  which the {kiwi} image resides will be available inside the appliance. This
  allows you to configure the repositories of your image from OBS itself
  and not having to modify the image description.

- `dir:///path/to/directory` or `file:///path/to/file`: an absolute path to
  a local directory or file available on the host building the
  appliance.

- `iso:///path/to/image.iso`: the specified ISO image will be mounted
  during the build of the {kiwi} image and a repository will be created
  pointing to the mounted ISO.
