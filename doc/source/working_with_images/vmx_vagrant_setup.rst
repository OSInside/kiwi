Image Description for Vagrant
=============================

.. sidebar:: Abstract

   This page provides further information for handling
   VMX images built with {kiwi} and references the following
   article:

   * :ref:`vmx`

`Vagrant <https://www.vagrantup.com>`_ is a framework to
implement consistent processing/testing work environments based on
Virtualization technologies. To run a system, Vagrant needs so-called
**boxes**. A box is a TAR archive containing a virtual disk image and
some metadata.

To build Vagrant boxes, you can use `Packer <https://www.packer.io>`_ which
is provided by Hashicorp itself. Packer is based on the official
installation media (DVDs) as shipped by the distribution vendor.

The {kiwi} way of building images might be helpful, if such a media does not
exist or does not suit your needs. For example, if the distribution is
still under development or you want to use a collection of your own
repositories. Note, that in contrast to Packer {kiwi} only supports the
libvirt and VirtualBox providers. Other providers require a different box
layout that is currently not supported by {kiwi}.

In addition, you can use the {kiwi} image description as source for the
`Open Build Service <https://openbuildservice.org>`_ which allows
building and maintaining boxes.

Vagrant expects boxes to be setup in a specific way (for details refer to
the `Vagrant box documentation
<https://www.vagrantup.com/docs/boxes/base.html>`_.), applied to the
referenced {kiwi} image description from :ref:`vmx`, the following steps are
required:

1. Update the image type setup

   .. code:: xml

      <type image="vmx" filesystem="ext4" format="vagrant">
          <bootloader name="grub2" timeout="0"/>
          <vagrantconfig provider="libvirt" virtualsize="42"/>
          <size unit="G">42</size>
      </type>

   This modifies the type to build a Vagrant box for the libvirt
   provider including a pre-defined disk size. The disk size is
   optional, but recommended to provide some free space on disk.

   For the VirtualBox provider, the additional attribute
   ``virtualbox_guest_additions_present`` can be set to ``true`` when the
   VirtualBox guest additions are installed in the {kiwi} image:

   .. code:: xml

      <type image="vmx" filesystem="ext4" format="vagrant">
          <bootloader name="grub2" timeout="0"/>
          <vagrantconfig
            provider="virtualbox"
            virtualbox_guest_additions_present="true"
            virtualsize="42"
          />
          <size unit="G">42</size>
      </type>

   The resulting Vagrant box then uses the ``vboxfs`` module for the
   synchronized folder instead of ``rsync``, that is used by default.

2. Add mandatory packages

   .. code:: xml

      <package name="sudo"/>
      <package name="openssh"/>

3. Add additional packages

   If you have set the attribute ``virtualbox_guest_additions_present`` to
   ``true``, add the VirtualBox guest additions. For openSUSE the following
   packages are required:

   .. code:: xml

      <package name="virtualbox-guest-tools"/>
      <package name="virtualbox-guest-x11"/>
      <package name="virtualbox-guest-kmp-default"/>

   Otherwise, you must add ``rsync``:

   .. code:: xml

      <package name="rsync"/>

   Note that {kiwi} cannot verify whether these packages are installed. If
   they are missing, the resulting Vagrant box will be broken.

4. Add Vagrant user

   .. code:: xml

      <users group='vagrant'>
          <user name='vagrant' password='vh4vw1N4alxKQ' home='/home/vagrant'/>
      </users>

   This adds the **vagrant** user to the system and applies the
   name of the user as the password for login.

5. Integrate public SSH key

   Vagrant requires an insecure public key pair [#f1]_ to be added to the
   authorized keys for the user ``vagrant`` so that Vagrant itself can
   connect to the box via ssh.
   The key can be obtained from `GitHub
   <https://github.com/hashicorp/vagrant/blob/master/keys/vagrant.pub>`_
   and should be inserted into the file
   :file:`home/vagrant/.ssh/authorized_keys`, which can be added as an
   overlay file into the image description.

   Keep in mind to set the file system permissions of
   :file:`home/vagrant/.ssh/` and :file:`home/vagrant/.ssh/authorized_keys`
   correctly, otherwise Vagrant will not be able to connect to your
   box. The following snippet can be added to :file:`config.sh`:

   .. code:: bash

      chmod 0600 /home/vagrant/.ssh/authorized_keys
      chown -R vagrant:vagrant /home/vagrant/

6. Create the default shared folder

   Vagrant boxes usually provide a default shared folder under
   :file:`/vagrant`. Consider adding this empty folder to your overlay
   files and ensure that the user ``vagrant`` has write permissions to
   it.

   Note, that the boxes that {kiwi} produces **require** this folder to
   exist, otherwise Vagrant will not be able to start them properly.

7. Setup and start SSH daemon

   In :file:`config.sh` add the start of sshd:

   .. code:: bash

      #======================================
      # Activate services
      #--------------------------------------
      baseInsertService sshd

   Also make sure to add the line **UseDNS=no** into
   :file:`/etc/ssh/sshd_config`. This can be done by an overlay file or by
   patching the file in the above mentioned :file:`config.sh` file.

8. Configure sudo for the Vagrant user

   Vagrant expects to have passwordless root permissions via ``sudo`` to be
   able to setup your box. Add the following line to :file:`/etc/sudoers`
   or add it into a new file :file:`/etc/sudoers.d/vagrant`:

   .. code::

      vagrant ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: ALL

   You can also use :command:`visudo` to verify that the resulting
   :file:`/etc/sudoers` or :file:`/etc/sudoers.d/vagrant` are valid:

   .. code:: bash

      visudo -cf /etc/sudoers
      if [ $? -ne 0 ]; then
          exit 1
      fi


An image built with the above setup creates a Vagrant box file with the
extension :file:`.vagrant.libvirt.box` or
:file:`.vagrant.virtualbox.box`. Add the box file to Vagrant with the
command:

.. code:: bash

   vagrant box add my-box image-file.vagrant.libvirt.box

.. note::

   Using the box with the libvirt provider requires alongside a correct
   Vagrant installation:

   - the plugin ``vagrant-libvirt`` to be installed
   - a running libvirtd daemon

Once added to Vagrant, boot the box and log in
with the following sequence of :command:`vagrant` commands:

.. code:: bash

   vagrant init my-box
   vagrant up --provider libvirt
   vagrant ssh


Customizing the embedded Vagrantfile
------------------------------------

.. warning:: This is an advanced topic and not required for most users


Vagrant ship with an embedded :file:`Vagrantfile` that carries settings
specific to this box, for instance the synchronization mechanism for the
shared folder. {kiwi} generates such a file automatically for you and it
should be sufficient for most use cases.

If a box requires different settings in the embedded :file:`Vagrantfile`,
then the user can provide {kiwi} with a path to an alternative via the
attribute `embebbed_vagrantfile` of the `vagrantconfig` element: it
specifies a relative path to the :file:`Vagrantfile` that will be included
in the finished box.

In the following example snippet from :file:`config.xml` we add a custom
:file:`MyVagrantfile` into the box (the file should be in the image
description directory next to :file:`config.sh`):

.. code:: xml

   <type image="vmx" filesystem="ext4" format="vagrant">
       <bootloader name="grub2" timeout="0"/>
       <vagrantconfig
         provider="libvirt"
         virtualsize="42"
         embedded_vagrantfile="MyVagrantfile"
       />
       <size unit="G">42</size>
   </type>


The option to provide a custom :file:`Vagrantfile` can be combined with the
usage of *profiles* (see :ref:`image-profiles`), so that
certain builds can use the automatically generated :file:`Vagrantfile` (in
the following example that is the Virtualbox build) and others get a
customized one (the libvirt profile in the following example):

.. code:: xml

   <?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>

   <image schemaversion="{schema_version}" name="{exc_image_base_name}">
     <!-- description goes here -->
     <profiles>
       <profile name="libvirt" description="Vagrant Box for Libvirt"/>
       <profile name="virtualbox" description="Vagrant Box for VirtualBox"/>
     </profiles>

     <!-- general preferences go here -->

     <preferences profiles="libvirt">
       <type
         image="vmx"
         filesystem="ext4"
         format="vagrant">
           <bootloader name="grub2" timeout="0"/>
           <vagrantconfig
             provider="libvirt"
             virtualsize="42"
             embedded_vagrantfile="LibvirtVagrantfile"
           />
           <size unit="G">42</size>
      </type>
      </preferences>
      <preferences profiles="virtualbox">
        <type
          image="vmx"
          filesystem="ext4"
          format="vagrant">
            <bootloader name="grub2" timeout="0"/>
            <vagrantconfig
              provider="virtualbox"
              virtualbox_guest_additions_present="true"
              virtualsize="42"
            />
            <size unit="G">42</size>
        </type>
      </preferences>

      <!-- remaining box description -->
    </image>


.. [#f1] The insecure key is removed from the box when the it is first
         booted via Vagrant.
