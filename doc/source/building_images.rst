Building Images for Supported Types
===================================

.. note::

   This document provides an overview about the supported {kiwi} image
   types. Before building an image with {kiwi} it's important to understand
   the different image types and their meaning.

Image Types
-----------

ISO Hybrid Live Image
  An iso image which can be dumped on a CD/DVD or USB stick
  and boots off from this media without interfering with other
  system storage components. A useful pocket system for testing
  and demo and debugging purposes.

Virtual Disk Image
  An image representing the system disk, useful for cloud frameworks
  like Amazon EC2, Google Compute Engine or Microsoft Azure.

OEM Expandable Disk Image
  An image representing an expandable system disk. This means after
  deployment the system can resize itself to the new disk geometry.
  The resize operation is configurable as part of the image description
  and an installation image for CD/DVD, USB stick and Network deployment
  can be created in addition.

Docker Container Image
  An archive image suitable for the docker container engine.
  The image can be loaded via the `docker load` command and
  works within the scope of the container engine

WSL Container Image
  An archive image suitable for the Windows Subsystem For Linux
  container engine. The image can be loaded From a Windows System
  that has support for WSL activated.

KIS Root File System Image
  An optional root filesystem image associated with a kernel and initrd.
  The use case for this component image type is highly customizable.
  Many different deployment strategies are possible.

Supported Distributions
-----------------------

{kiwi} can build images for the distributions which are **equal** or **newer**
compared to the table below. For anything older use the
legacy {kiwi} version *v7.x* For more details on the legacy {kiwi},
see: :ref:`legacy_kiwi`

The most compatible environment is provided if the build host is of the same
distribution than the target image. This always applies for the Open Build
Service (OBS). In other cases please check the table if your target combination
is known to be supported.

.. admonition:: dnf

   dnf is the package manager used on Fedora and RHEL and is
   the successor of yum. When {kiwi} builds images for this distributions
   the latest version of dnf is required to be installed on the host to
   build the image.

In general, our goal is to support any major distribution with {kiwi}. However
for building images we rely on core tools which are not under our control.
Also several design aspects of distributions like **secure boot** and working
with **upstream projects** are different and not influenced by us. There
are many side effects that can be annoying especially if the build host
is not of the same distribution vendor than the image target.

Supported Platforms and Architectures
-------------------------------------

Images built with {kiwi} are designed for a specific use case. The author of
the image description sets this with the contents in the {kiwi} XML document
as well as custom scripts and services. The following list provides an
abstract of the platforms where {kiwi} built images are productively used:

* Amazon EC2
* Microsoft Azure
* Google Compute Engine
* Private Data Centers based on OpenStack
* Bare metal deployments e.g Microsoft Azure Large Instance
* SAP workloads

The majority of the workloads is based on the x86 architecture. {kiwi}
also supports other architectures, shown in the table below:

.. table::
   :align: left

   +--------------+---------------------+
   | Architecture | Supported           |
   +==============+=====================+
   | x86_64       | yes                 |
   +--------------+---------------------+
   | ix86         | yes **note:distro** |
   +--------------+---------------------+
   | s390/s390x   | yes **note:distro** |
   +--------------+---------------------+
   | arm/aarch64  | yes **note:distro** |
   +--------------+---------------------+
   | ppc64        | no (alpha-phase)    |
   +--------------+---------------------+

.. admonition:: distro

   The support status for an architecture depends on the distribution.
   If the distribution does not build its packages for the desired
   architecture, {kiwi} will not be able to build an image for it
