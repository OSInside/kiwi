Image Description Elements
==========================

.. note::

   This document provides a reference for the elements
   and attributes of the {kiwi} XML document in version |version|

.. _sec.image:

<image>
-------

The toplevel of any {kiwi} image description

.. code:: xml

   <image schemaversion="{schema_version}" name="{exc_image_base_name}">
       <!-- descendants -->
   </image>

The image definition starts with an image tag and requires the schema
format at version {schema_version}. The attribute name specifies the name
of the image which is also used for the filenames created by KIWI. Because
we don’t want spaces in filenames the name attribute must not have any
spaces in its name.

The following optional attributes can be inserted in the image tag:

displayname
   Allows setup of the boot menu title for the selected boot loader. So
   you can have *suse-SLED-foo* as the image name but a different name
   as the boot display name. Spaces are not allowed in the display name
   because it causes problems for some boot loaders and kiwi did not
   take the effort to separate the ones which can display them correctly
   from the ones which can't

id
   sets an identification number which appears as file ``/etc/ImageID``
   within the image.

.. _sec.include:

<include>
---------

Optional include of XML file content from file

.. code:: xml

   <image schemaversion="{schema_version}" name="{exc_image_base_name}">
       <include from="file://description.xml"/>
   </image> 

with file :file:`description.xml` as follows:

.. code:: xml

   <image>
       <description type="system">
           <author>name</author>
           <contact>contact</contact>
           <specification>text</specification>
       </description>
   </image>

This will replace the `include` statement with the contents
of :file:`description.xml`. The validation of the result happens
after the inclusion of all `include` references. The value for
the `from` attribute is interpreted as an URI, as of now only
local URI types are supported as well as the `this://` resource
locator which translates into the path to the KIWI image
description.

.. note::

   The include information must be embedded into an `<image>`
   root node. Only the inner elements of the root node will
   be included. The processing of XML data via XSLT always
   requires a root node which is the reason why this is
   required to be specified for include files as well.

.. note::

   Nesting of include statements in other include files is
   not supported. This will lead to unresolved include
   statements in the final document and will cause the
   runtime checker to complain about it.

.. note::

   The include is implemented via a XSLT stylesheet and therefore
   expects an XML document. Other markup formats are not supported
   as include reference.

.. _sec.description:

<description>
-------------

Provide an image identity.

.. code:: xml

   <description type="system">
     <author>name</author>
     <contact>contact</contact>
     <specification>text</specification>
   </description>

The mandatory description section contains information about the creator
of this image description. The attribute type could be either of the
value `system` which indicates this is a system image description or at
value `boot` for custom kiwi boot image descriptions.

The following optional sub sections can be inserted below the description tag:

license
  Specifies the license name which applies to this image description.

.. _sec.preferences:

<preferences>
-------------

Setup image type and layout.

.. code:: xml

   <preferences arch="arch">
     <version>1.2.3</version>
     <packagemanager name="zypper"/>
     <type image="tbz"/>
   </preferences>

The mandatory preferences section contains information about the
supported image type(s), the used package manager, the version of this
image, and further optional elements. The preferences section can
be configured to apply only for a certain architecture. In this
case specify the `arch` attribute with a value as it is reported
by :command:`uname -m`

<preferences><version>
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The mandatory image version must be a three-part version number of the
format: **Major**.\ **Minor**.\ **Release**. In case of changes to
the image description the following rules should apply:

* For smaller image modifications that do not add or remove any new
  packages, only the release number is incremented. The XML description
  file(``config.xml``) remains unchanged.

* For image changes that involve the addition or removal of packages
  the minor number is incremented and the release number is reset.

* For image changes that changes the behavior or geometry of the
  image file the major number is incremented.

<preferences><packagemanager>
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The mandatory packagemanager element specifies which package manager
should be used to handle software packages. The packagemanager setup
is connected to the distribution used to build the image. The following
table shows which package manager is connected to which distributor:

+--------------+-----------------+
| Distributor  | Package Manager |
+==============+=================+
| SUSE         | zypper          |
+--------------+-----------------+
| RedHat       | dnf             |
+--------------+-----------------+
| Debian Based | apt             |
+--------------+-----------------+ 
| Arch Linux   | pacman          |
+--------------+-----------------+

In general the specification of one preferences section is sufficient.
However, it’s possible to specify multiple preferences sections and
distinguish between the sections via the profiles attribute.

In combination with the above the preferences element supports the
following optional elements:

<preferences><rpm-locale-filtering>
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
locale-filtering can be set to "true" or "false". If set to "true" it
sets the install_lang macro for RPM based installations to the RPM
configured locale list. This results in language specific files to
become filtered out by `rpm` if they don't match the configured list.

.. code:: xml

   <preferences>
     <rpm-locale-filtering>true</rpm-locale-filtering>
   </preferences>

.. note::

   It depends on the individual package design if the install_lang
   macro contents apply to the package or not.

<preferences><rpm-check-signatures>
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Specifies whether package signatures should be checked or not

.. code:: xml

   <preferences>
     <rpm-check-signatures>true</rpm-check-signatures>
   </preferences>

<preferences><rpm-excludedocs>
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Specifies whether files marked as documentation should be skipped
during installation

.. code:: xml

   <preferences>
     <rpm-excludedocs>true</rpm-excludedocs>
   </preferences>

<preferences><keytable>
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Specifies the name of the console keymap to use. The value
corresponds to a map file in ``/usr/share/kbd/keymaps/xkb``.

.. code:: xml

   <preferences>
     <keytable>us</keytable>
   </preferences>

<preferences><timezone>
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Specifies the time zone. Available time zones are located in the
``/usr/share/zoneinfo`` directory. Specify the attribute value
relative to ``/usr/share/zoneinfo``. For example, specify
Europe/Berlin for ``/usr/share/zoneinfo/Europe/Berlin``.

.. code:: xml

   <preferences>
     <timezone>Europe/Berlin</timezone>
   </preferences>

<preferences><locale>
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Specifies the name of the UTF-8 locale to use, which defines the
contents of the RC_LANG system environment variable used in the
image and to run the custom scripts specified as part of the
{kiwi} image description. Please note only UTF-8 locales are
supported here which also means that the encoding must *not* be part
of the locale information. This means you need to specify the
locale using the 4-digit name like the following example: en_US or
en_US,de_DE

.. code:: xml

   <preferences>
     <locale>en_US</locale>
   </preferences>

<preferences><bootsplash-theme>
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Specifies the name of the plymouth bootsplash theme to use

.. code:: xml

   <preferences>
     <bootsplash-theme>bgrt</bootsplash-theme>
   </preferences>

<preferences><bootloader-theme>
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Specifies the name of the bootloader theme to use if that used
bootloader has theme support.

.. code:: xml

   <preferences>
     <bootloader-theme>openSUSE</bootloader-theme>
   </preferences>


Along with the version and the packagemanager at least one image type
element must be specified to indicate which image type should be build.

<preferences><release-version>
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Specifies the distribution global release version as consumed
by package managers. Currently the release version is not set or
set to `0` for package managers which requires a value to operate.
With the optional `release-version` section, users have an
opportunity to specify a custom value which is passed along the package
manager to define the distribution release.

.. note::

   The release version information is currently
   used in dnf and microdnf package managers only. It might
   happen that it gets applied to the other package manager
   backends as well. This will happen on demand though.

<preferences><type>
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
At least one type element must be configured. It is possible to
specify multiple type elements in a preferences block. To set a given
type description as the default image use the boolean attribute primary
and set its value to true:

.. code:: xml

   <preferences>
     <type image="typename" primary="true"/>
   </preferences>

The image type to be created is determined by the value of the image
attribute. The following list describes the supported types and
possible values of the image attribute:

image="tbz"
  A simple tar archive image. The tbz type packs the contents of
  the image root tree into a xz compressed tarball.

image="btrfs|ext2|ext3|ext4|squashfs|xfs"
  A filesystem image. The image root tree data is packed into a
  filesystem image of the given type. An image of that type can
  be loop mounted and accessed according to the capabiities of
  the selected filesystem.

image="iso"
  An iso image which can be dumped on a CD/DVD or USB stick
  and boots off from this media without interfering with other
  system storage components. A useful pocket system for testing
  and demo and debugging purposes.

image="oem"
  An image representing an expandable system disk. This means after
  deployment the system can resize itself to the new disk geometry.
  The resize operation is configurable as part of the image description
  and an installation image for CD/DVD, USB stick and Network deployment
  can be created in addition. For use in cloud frameworks like
  Amazon EC2, Google Compute Engine or Microsoft Azure this disk
  type also supports the common virtual disk formats.

image="docker"
  An archive image suitable for the docker container engine.
  The image can be loaded via the `docker load` command and
  works within the scope of the container engine

image="oci"
  An archive image that builds a container matching the OCI
  (Open Container Interface) standard. The container should be
  able to run with any oci compliant container engine.

image="appx"
  An archive image suitable for the Windows Subsystem For Linux
  container engine. The image can be loaded From a Windows System
  that has support for WSL activated.

image="kis"
  An optional root filesystem image associated with a kernel and initrd.
  The use case for this component image type is highly customizable.
  Many different deployment strategies are possible.

For completion of a type description, there could be several other
optional attributes and child elements. The `type` element supports a
plethora of optional attributes, some of these are only relevant for
certain build types and will be covered in extra chapters that describes
the individual image types more detailed. Certain attributes are however
useful for nearly all build types and will be covered next:

bootpartition="true|false":
  Boolean parameter notifying {kiwi} whether an extra boot
  partition should be used or not (the default depends on the current
  layout). This will override {kiwi}'s default layout.

bootpartsize="nonNegativeInteger":
  For images with a separate boot partition this attribute
  specifies the size in MB. If not set the boot partition
  size is set to 200 MB

efipartsize="nonNegativeInteger":
  For images with an EFI fat partition this attribute
  specifies the size in MB. If not set the EFI partition
  size is set to 20 MB

efiparttable="msdos|gpt":
  For images with an EFI firmware specifies the partition
  table type to use. If not set defaults to the GPT partition
  table type

btrfs_quota_groups="true|false":
  Boolean parameter to activate filesystem quotas if
  the filesystem is `btrfs`. By default quotas are inactive.

btrfs_root_is_snapshot="true|false":
  Boolean parameter that tells {kiwi} to install
  the system into a btrfs snapshot. The snapshot layout is compatible with
  snapper. By default snapshots are turned off.

btrfs_root_is_readonly_snapshot="true|false":
  Boolean parameter notifying {kiwi} that
  the btrfs root filesystem snapshot has to made read-only. if this option
  is set to true, the root filesystem snapshot it will be turned into
  read-only mode, once all data has been placed to it. The option is only
  effective if `btrfs_root_is_snapshot` is also set to true. By default the
  root filesystem snapshot is writable.

compressed="true|false":
  Specifies whether the image output file should be
  compressed or not. This option is only used for filesystem only images or
  for the `pxe` or `cpio` types.

editbootconfig="file_path":
  Specifies the path to a script which is called right
  before the bootloader is installed. The script runs relative to the
  directory which contains the image structure.

editbootinstall="file_path":
  Specifies the path to a script which is called right
  after the bootloader is installed. The script runs relative to the
  directory which contains the image structure.

filesystem="btrfs|ext2|ext3|ext4|squashfs|xfs":
  The root filesystem

firmware="efi|uefi":
  Specifies the boot firmware of the appliance, supported
  options are: `bios`, `ec2`, `efi`, `uefi`, `ofw` and `opal`.
  This attribute is used to differentiate the image according to the
  firmware which boots up the system. It mostly impacts the disk
  layout and the partition table type. By default `bios` is used on x86,
  `ofw` on PowerPC and `efi` on ARM.

force_mbr="true|false":
  Boolean parameter to force the usage of a MBR partition
  table even if the system would default to GPT. This is occasionally
  required on ARM systems that use a EFI partition layout but which must
  not be stored in a GPT. Note that forcing a MBR partition table incurs
  limitations with respect to the number of available partitions and their
  sizes.

fsmountoptions="option_string":
  Specifies the filesystem mount options which are passed
  via the `-o` flag to :command:`mount` and are included in
  :file:`/etc/fstab`.

fscreateoptions="option_string":
  Specifies the filesystem options used to create the
  filesystem. In {kiwi} the filesystem utility to create a filesystem is
  called without any custom options. The default options are filesystem
  specific and are provided along with the package that provides the
  filesystem utility. For the Linux `ext[234]` filesystem, the default
  options can be found in the :file:`/etc/mke2fs.conf` file. Other
  filesystems provides this differently and documents information
  about options and their defaults in the respective manual page, e.g
  :command:`man mke2fs`. With the `fscreateoptions` attribute it's possible
  to directly influence how the filesystem will be created. The options
  provided as a string are passed to the command that creates the
  filesystem without any further validation by {kiwi}. For example, to turn
  off the journal on creation of an ext4 filesystem the following option
  would be required:

  .. code:: xml

     <preferences>
       <type fscreateoptions="-O ^has_journal"/>
     </preferences>

kernelcmdline="string":
  Additional kernel parameters passed to the kernel by the
  bootloader.

luks="passphrase":
  Supplying a value will trigger the encryption of the partitions
  using the LUKS extension and using the provided string as the
  password. Note that the password must be entered when booting the
  appliance!

target_blocksize="number":
  Specifies the image blocksize in bytes which has to
  match the logical blocksize of the target storage device. By default 512
  Bytes is used, which works on many disks. You can obtain the blocksize
  from the `SSZ` column in the output of the following command:

  .. code:: shell-session

     blockdev --report $DEVICE

target_removable="true|false":
  Indicate if the target disk for oem images is deployed
  to a removable device e.g a USB stick or not. This only
  affects the EFI setup if requested and in the end avoids
  the creation of a custom boot menu entry in the firmware
  of the target machine. By default the target disk is
  expected to be non-removable

spare_part="number":
  Request a spare partition right before the root partition
  of the requested size. The attribute takes a size value
  and allows a unit in MB or GB, e.g 200M. If no unit is given
  the value is considered to be mbytes. A spare partition
  can only be configured for the disk image type oem

spare_part_mountpoint="dir_path":
  Specify mount point for spare partition in the system.
  Can only be configured for the disk image type oem

spare_part_fs="btrfs|ext2|ext3|ext4|xfs":
  Specify filesystem for spare partition in the system.
  Can only be configured for the disk image type oem

spare_part_fs_attributes="attribute_list":
  Specify filesystem attributes for the spare partition.
  Attributes can be specified as comma separated list.
  Currently the attributes `no-copy-on-write` and `synchronous-updates`
  are available. Can only be configured for the disk image
  type oem

spare_part_is_last="true|false":
  Specify if the spare partition should be the last one in
  the partition table. Can only be configured for the `oem`
  type with oem-resize switched off. By default the root
  partition is the last one and the spare partition lives
  before it. With this attribute that setup can be toggled.
  However, if the root partition is no longer the last one
  the oem repart/resize code can no longer work because
  the spare part would block it. Because of that moving
  the spare part at the end of the disk is only applied
  if oem-resize is switched off. There is a runtime
  check in the {kiwi} code to check this condition

devicepersistency="by-uuid|by-label":
  Specifies which method to use for persistent device names.
  This will affect all files written by kiwi that includes
  device references for example `etc/fstab` or the `root=`
  parameter in the kernel commandline. By default by-uuid
  is used

squashfscompression="uncompressed|gzip|lzo|lz4|xz|zstd":
  Specifies the compression type for mksquashfs

overlayroot="true|false"
  For the `oem` type only, specifies to use an `overlayfs` based root
  filesystem consisting out of a squashfs compressed read-only root
  filesystem combined with a write-partition or tmpfs.
  The optional kernel boot parameter `rd.root.overlay.readonly` can
  be used to point the write area into a `tmpfs` instead of
  the existing persistent write-partition. In this mode all
  written data is temporary until reboot of the system. The kernel
  boot parameter `rd.root.overlay.size` can be used to configure
  the size for the `tmpfs` that is used for the `overlayfs` mount
  process if `rd.root.overlay.readonly` is requested. That size
  basically configures the amount of space available for writing
  new data during the runtime of the system. The default value
  is set to `50%` which means one half of the available RAM space can
  be used for writing new data. By default the persistent
  write-partition is used. The size of that partition can be
  influenced via the optional `<size>` element in the `<type>`
  section or via the optional `<oem-resize>` element in the
  `<oemconfig>` section of the XML description. Setting a fixed
  `<size>` value will set the size of the image disk to that
  value and results in an image file of that size. The available
  space for the write partition is that size reduced by the
  size the squashfs read-only system needs. If the `<oem-resize>`
  element is set to `true` an eventually given `<size>` element
  will not have any effect because the write partition will be
  resized on first boot to the available disk space.

overlayroot_write_partition="true|false"
  For the `oem` type only, allows to specify if the extra read-write
  partition in an `overlayroot` setup should be created or not.
  By default the partition is created and the kiwi-overlay dracut
  module also expect it to be present. However, the overlayroot
  feature can also be used without dracut (`initrd_system="none"`)
  and under certain circumstances it is handy to configure if the
  partition table should contain the read-write partition or not.

bootfilesystem="ext2|ext3|ext4|fat32|fat16":
  If an extra boot partition is required this attribute
  specify which filesystem should be used for it. The
  type of the selected bootloader might overwrite this
  setting if there is no alternative possible though.

flags="overlay|dmsquash"
  For the iso image type specifies the live iso technology and
  dracut module to use. If set to overlay the kiwi-live dracut
  module will be used to support a live iso system based on
  squashfs+overlayfs. If set to dmsquash the dracut standard
  dmsquash-live module will be used to support a live iso
  system based on the capabilities of the upstream dracut
  module.

format="gce|ova|qcow2|vagrant|vmdk|vdi|vhd|vhdx|vhd-fixed":
  For disk image type oem, specifies the format of
  the virtual disk such that it can run on the desired target
  virtualization platform.

formatoptions="string":
  Specifies additional format options passed on to qemu-img
  formatoptions is a comma separated list of format specific
  options in a name=value format like qemu-img expects it.
  kiwi will take the information and pass it as parameter to
  the -o option in the qemu-img call

fsmountoptions="string":
  Specifies the filesystem mount options which also ends up in fstab
  The string given here is passed as value to the -o option of mount

fscreateoptions="string":
  Specifies options to use at creation time of the filesystem

force_mbr="true|false":
  Force use of MBR (msdos table) partition table even if the
  use of the GPT would be the natural choice. On e.g some
  arm systems an EFI partition layout is required but must
  not be stored in a GPT. For those rare cases this attribute
  allows to force the use of the msdos table including all
  its restrictions in max partition size and amount of
  partitions

gpt_hybrid_mbr="true|false":
  For GPT disk types only: Create a hybrid GPT/MBR partition table

hybridpersistent="true|false":
  For the live ISO type, triggers the creation of a partition for
  a COW file to keep data persistent over a reboot

hybridpersistent_filesystem="ext4|xfs":
  For the live ISO type, set the filesystem to use for persistent
  writing if a hybrid image is used as disk on e.g a USB Stick.
  By default the ext4 filesystem is used.

initrd_system="kiwi|dracut|none":
  Specify which initrd builder to use, default is set to `dracut`.
  If set to `none` the image is build without an initrd. Depending
  on the image type this can lead to a non bootable system as its
  now a kernel responsibility if the given root device can be
  mounted or not.

metadata_path="dir_path":
  Specifies a path to additional metadata required for the selected
  image type or its tools used to create that image type.

  .. note::

     Currently this is only effective for the appx container image type.

installboot="failsafe-install|harddisk|install":
  Specifies the bootloader default boot entry for the initial
  boot of a {kiwi} install image.

  .. note::

     This value is only evaluated for grub

install_continue_on_timeout="true|false":
  Specifies the boot timeout handling for the {kiwi}
  install image. If set to "true" the configured timeout
  or its default value applies. If set to "false" no
  timeout applies in the boot menu of the install image.

installprovidefailsafe="true|false":
  Specifies if the bootloader menu should provide an
  failsafe entry with special kernel parameters or not

installiso="true|false"
  Specifies if an install iso image should be created.
  This attribute is only available for the `oem` type.
  The generated ISO image is an hybrid ISO which can be
  used as disk on e.g a USB stick or as ISO.

installpxe="true|false":
  Specifies if a tarball that contains all data for a pxe network
  installation should be created. This attribute is only available
  for the `oem` type.

mediacheck="true|false":
  For ISO images, specifies if the bootloader menu should provide an
  mediacheck entry to verify ISO integrity or not. Disabled by default
  and only available for the x86 arch family.

mdraid="mirroring|striping":
  Setup software raid in degraded mode with one disk
  Thus only mirroring and striping is possible

primary="true|false":
  Specifies this type to be the primary type. If no type option
  is given on the commandline, {kiwi} will build this type

ramonly="true|false":
  For all images that are configured to use the overlay filesystem
  this setting forces any COW(Copy-On-Write) action to happen in RAM.

rootfs_label="string":
  Label name to set for the root filesystem. By default `ROOT` is used

volid="string":
  For the ISO type only, specifies the volume ID (volume name or label)
  to be written into the master block. There is space for 32 characters.

vhdfixedtag="GUID_string":
  For the VHD disk format, specifies the GUID

derived_from="string":
  For container images, specifies the image URI of the container image.
  The image created by {kiwi} will use the specified container as the
  base root to work on.

publisher="string":
  For ISO images, specifies the publisher name of the ISO.

The following sections shows the supported child elements of the `type`
element including references to their usage in a detailed type setup:

.. _preferences-type-bootloader:

<preferences><type><bootloader>
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The `bootloader` element is used to select the bootloader. At the moment,
`grub2`, `isolinux`, `zipl` and `grub2_s390x_emu` (a combination of zipl
and a userspace GRUB2) are supported. The special `custom` entry allows
to skip the bootloader configuration and installation and leaves this up
to the user, which can be done by using the `editbootinstall` and
`editbootconfig` custom scripts.

In addition to the mandatory name attribute, the following optional
attributes are supported:

console="console|gfxterm|serial":
  Specifies the bootloader console. The attribute is available for the
  grub and isolinux bootloader types. By default, a graphics console
  setup is used.

grub_template="filename":
  Specifies a custom grub bootloader template file which will be used
  instead of the one provided with Kiwi. A static bootloader template to
  create the grub config file is only used in Kiwi if the native method
  via the grub mkconfig toolchain does not work properly. As of today,
  this is only the case for live and install ISO images. Thus, this
  setting only affects the oem and iso image types.

  The template file should contain a `Template string
  <https://docs.python.org/3.4/library/string.html#template-strings>`_
  and can use the following variables:

  +-----------------------+----------------------------------------------+
  | Variable              | Description                                  |

serial_line="string":
  Specifies the bootloader serial line setup. The setup is effective if
  the bootloader console is set to use the serial line. The attribute is
  available for the grub bootloader only.

timeout="number":
  Specifies the boot timeout in seconds prior to launching the default
  boot option. By default, the timeout is set to 10 seconds. It makes
  sense to set this value to `0` for images intended to be started
  non-interactively (e.g. virtual machines).

timeout_style="countdown|hidden":
  Specifies the boot timeout style to control the way in which the timeout
  interacts with displaying the menu. If set, the display of the
  bootloader menu is delayed after the timeout expired. In countdown mode,
  an indication of the remaining time is displayed. The attribute is
  available for the grub loader only.

targettype="CDL|LDL|FBA|SCSI":
  Specifies the device type of the disk zipl should boot.
  On zFCP devices, use `SCSI`; on DASD devices, use `CDL` or `LDL`; on
  emulated DASD devices, use `FBA`. The attribute is available for the
  zipl loader only.

.. _sec.repository:

<repository>
-------------

Setup software sources for the image.

.. code:: xml

   <repository>
     <source path="uri"/>
   </repository>

The mandatory repository element specifies the location and type of a
repository to be used by the package manager as a package installation
source. {kiwi} supports apt, dnf, pacman and zypper as package managers,
specified with the packagemanager element. The repository element has
the following optional attributes:

alias="name"
  Specifies an alternative name for the configured repository. If the
  attribute is not specified {kiwi} will generate a random alias name
  for the repository.

components="name"
  Used for Debian (apt) based repositories only. Specifies the
  component name that should be used from the repository. By default
  the `main` component is used

distribution="name"
  Used for Debian (apt) based repositories only. Specifies the
  distribution name to be used on call of `debootstrap`

imageonly="true|false"
  Specifies whether or not this repository should be configured in
  the resulting image without using it at build time. By default
  the value is set to false

repository_gpgcheck="true|false"
  Specifies whether or not this specific repository is configured to
  to run repository signature validation. If not set, no value is
  appended into the repository configuration file. If set the
  relevant key information needs to be provided on the {kiwi}
  commandline using the `--signing-key` option or via the `<signing>`
  element as part of the `<repository><source>` setting in the
  image description.

customize="/path/to/custom_script"
  Custom script hook which is invoked with the repo file as parameter
  for each file created by {kiwi}.

  .. note::

     If the script is provided as relative path it will
     be searched in the image description directory

imageinclude="true|false"
  Specifies whether the given repository should be configured as a
  repository in the image or not. The default behavior is that
  repositories used to build an image are not configured as a
  repository inside the image. This feature allows you to change the
  behavior by setting the value to true.

  .. note:: Scope of repository uri's

     The repository is configured in the image according to the source
     path as specified with the path attribute of the source element.
     Therefore, if the path is not a fully qualified URL, you may need
     to adjust the repository file in the image to accommodate the
     expected location. It is recommended that you use the alias
     attribute in combination with the imageinclude attribute to
     avoid having unpredictable random names assigned to the
     repository you wish to include in the image.

password="string"
  Specifies a password for the given repository. The password attribute
  must be used in combination with the username attribute. Dependent on
  the repository location this information may not be used.

username="name"
  Specifies a user name for the given repository. The username
  attribute must be used in combination with the password attribute.
  Dependent on the repository location this information may not be
  used.

prefer-license="true|false"
  The repository providing this attribute will be used primarily to
  install the license tarball if found on that repository. If no
  repository with a preferred license attribute exists, the search
  happens over all repositories. It's not guaranteed in that case that
  the search order follows the repository order like they are written
  into the XML description.

priority="number"
  Specifies the repository priority for this given repository. Priority
  values are treated differently by different package managers.
  Repository priorities allow the package management system to
  disambiguate packages that may be contained in more than one of the
  configured repositories. The zypper package manager for example
  prefers packages from a repository with a *lower* priority over
  packages from a repository with higher priority values.
  The value 99 means “no priority is set”. For other package managers
  please refer to the individual documentation about repository priorities.

sourcetype="baseurl|metalink|mirrorlist"
  Specifies the source type of the repository path. Depending on if the
  source path is a simple url or a pointer to a metadata file or mirror
  list, the configured package manager needs to be setup appropriately.
  By default the source is expected to be a simple repository baseurl.

use_for_bootstrap="true|false"
  Used for Debian (apt) based repositories only. It specifies whether
  this repository should be the one used for bootstrapping or not.
  It is set to 'false' by default. Only a single repository is allowed
  to be used for bootstrapping, if no repository is set for the bootstrap
  the last one in the description XML is used.
  
<repository><source>
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The location of a repository is specified by the path attribute of the
mandatory source child element:

.. code:: xml

   <repository alias="kiwi">
     <source path="{exc_kiwi_repo}"/>
   </repository>

The location specification may include
the `%arch` macro which will expand to the architecture of the image
building host. The value for the path attribute may begin with any of
the following location indicators:

* ``dir:///local/path``
  An absolute path to a directory accessible through the local file system.

* ``ftp://<ftp://>``
  A ftp protocol based network location.

* ``http://<http://>``
  A http protocol based network location.

* ``https://<https://>``
  A https protocol based network location.

  .. note:: https repositories

     When specifying a https location for a repository it is generally
     necessary to include the openssl certificates and a cracklib word
     dictionary as package entries in the bootstrap section of the
     image configuration. The names of the packages to include are
     individual to the used distribution. On SUSE systems as one example
     this would be `openssl-certs` and `cracklib-dict-full`

* ``iso://<iso://>``
  An absolute path to an .iso file accessible via the local file
  system. {kiwi} will loop mount the the .iso file to a temporary
  directory with a generated name. The generated path is provided to
  the specified package manager as a directory based repository location.

* ``obs://Open:Build:Service:Project:Name``
  A reference to a project in the Open Build Service (OBS). {kiwi}
  translates the given project path into a remote url at which
  the given project hosts the packages.
  
* ``obsrepositories:/``
  A placeholder for the Open Build Service (OBS) to indicate that all
  repositories are taken from the project configuration in OBS.

A repository `<source>` element can optionally contain one ore more
signing keys for the packages from this repository like shown in the
following example:

.. code:: xml

   <repository alias="kiwi">
     <source path="{exc_kiwi_repo}">
       <signing key="/path/to/sign_key_a"/>
       <signing key="/path/to/sign_key_b"/>
     </source>
   </repository>

All signing keys from all repositories will be collected and
incorporated into the keyring as used by the selected package
manager.

.. _sec.packages:

<packages>
-----------

Setup software components to be installed in the image.

.. code:: xml

   <packages type="type"/>

The mandatory packages element specifies the setup of a packages
group for the given type. The value of the type attribute specifies
at which state in the build process the packages group gets handled,
supported values are as follows:

type="bootstrap"
  Bootstrap packages, list of packages to be installed first into
  a new (empty) root tree. The packages list the required components
  to support a chroot environment from which further software
  components can be installed

type="image"
  Image packages, list of packages to be installed as part of a chroot
  operation inside of the new root tree.

type="uninstall|delete"
  Packages to be uninstalled or deleted. For further details
  see :ref:`uninstall-system-packages`

type="*image_type_name*"
  Packages to be installed for the given image type name. For example
  if set to type="iso", the packages in this group will only be
  installed if the iso image type is build.


The packages element must contain at least one child element of the
following list to provide specific configuration information for the
specified packages group:

<packages><package>
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
.. code:: xml

   <packages type="image"/>
     <package name="name" arch="arch"/>
   </packages>

The package element installs the given package name. The optional
`arch` attribute can be used to limit the installation of the package
to the host architecture from which {kiwi} is called. The `arch`
attribute is also available in all of the following elements.

<packages><namedCollection>
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
.. code:: xml

   <packages type="image" patternType="onlyRequired">
     <namedCollection name="base"/>
   </packages>

The namedCollection element is used to install a number of packages
grouped together under a name. This is a feature of the individual
distribution and used in the implementation of the {kiwi} package
manager backend. At the moment collections are only supported for
SUSE and RedHat based distributions. The optional `patternType` attribute
is used to control the behavior of the dependency resolution of
the package collection. `onlyRequired` installs only the collection
and its required packages. `plusRecommended` installs the collection,
any of its required packages and any recommended packages.

.. note:: Collections on SUSE

   On SUSE based distributions collections are called `patterns` and are
   just simple packages. To get the names of the patterns such that
   they can be used in a namedCollection type the following command:
   `$ zypper patterns`. If for some reason the collection name cannot
   be used it is also possible to add the name of the package that
   provides the collection as part of a `package` element. To get the
   names of the pattern packages type the following command:
   `$ zypper search patterns`. By convention all packages that starts
   with the name "patterns-" are representing a pattern package.

.. note:: Collections on RedHat

   On RedHat based distributions collections are called `groups` and are
   extra metadata. To get the names of these groups type the following
   command: `$ dnf group list`. Please note that group names are allowed
   to contain whitespace characters.

<packages><collectionModule>
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
.. code:: xml

   <packages type="bootstrap">
       <collectionModule name="module" stream="stream" enable="true|false"/>
   </packages>

In CentOS Stream >= 8 and Red Hat Enterprise Linux >= 8, there are
Application Streams that are offered in the form of modules
(using Fedora Modularity technology). To build images that use
this content {kiwi} offers to enable/disable modules when using
the `dnf` or `microdnf` package manager backend. Modules are setup
prior the bootstrap phase and its setup persists as part of the
image.

There are the following constraints when adding `collectionModule`
elements:

* `collectionModule` elements can only be specified as part of the
  `<packages type="bootstrap">` section. This is because the setup of
  modules must be done once and as early as possible in the process
  of installing the image root tree.

* Disabling a module can only be done as a whole and therefore the
  `stream` attribute is not allowed for disabling modules. For
  enabling modules the stream` attribute is optional

* The `enable` attribute is mandatory because it should be an explicit
  setting if a module is effectively used or not.

<packages><archive>
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
.. code:: xml

   <packages type="image"/>
     <archive name="name" target_dir="some/path"/>
   </packages>

The archive element takes the `name` attribute and looks up the
given name as file on the system. If specified relative {kiwi}
looks up the name in the image description directory. The archive
is installed using the `tar` program. Thus the file name is
expected to be a tar archive. The compression of the archive is
detected automatically by the tar program. The optional target_dir
attribute can be used to specify a target directory to unpack the
archive.

<packages><ignore>
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
.. code:: xml

   <packages type="image"/>
     <ignore name="name"/>
   </packages>

The ignore element instructs the used package manager to ignore the
given package name at installation time. Please note whether or not
the package can be ignored is up to the package manager. Packages
that are hard required by other packages in the install procedure
cannot be ignored and the package manager will simply ignore the
request.

<packages><product>
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
.. code:: xml

   <packages type="image">
     <product name="name"/>
   </packages>

The product element instructs the used package manager to install
the given product. What installation of a product means is up to
the package manager and also distribution specific. This feature
currently only works on SUSE based distributions

.. _sec.users:

<users>
--------

Setup image users.

.. code:: xml

   <users>
     <user
       name="user"
       groups="group_list"
       home="dir"
       id="number"
       password="text"
       pwdformat="encrypted|plain"
       realname="name"
       shell="path"
     />
   </users>

The optional users element contains the user setup {kiwi} should create
in the system. At least one user child element must be specified as
part of the users element. Multiple user elements may be specified.

Each `user` element represents a specific user that is added or
modified. The following attributes are mandatory:

name="name":
  the UNIX username

password="string"
  The password for this user account. It can be provided either
  in cleartext form or encrypted. An encrypted password can be created
  using `openssl` as follows:

  .. code::

     $ openssl passwd -1 -salt xyz PASSWORD

  It is also possible to specify the password as a non encrypted string
  by using the pwdformat attribute and setting it’s value to `plain`.
  {kiwi} will then encrypt the password prior to the user being added
  to the system.

  .. warning:: plain text passwords

     We do not recommend plain passwords as they will be readable in
     the image configuration in plain text

  All specified users and groups will be created if they do not already
  exist. The defined users will be part of the group(s) specified
  with the groups attribute or belong to the default group as configured
  in the system. If specified the first entry in the groups list is used
  as the login group.

Additionally, the following optional attributes can be specified:

home="path":
  The path to the user's home directory

groups="group_a,group_b":
  A comma separated list of UNIX groups. The first element of the
  list is used as the user's primary group. The remaining elements are
  appended to the user's supplementary groups. When no groups are assigned
  then the system's default primary group will be used.

id="number":
  The numeric user id of this account.

pwdformat="plain|encrypted":
  The format in which `password` is provided. The default if not
  specified is `encrypted`.

.. _sec.profiles:

<profiles>
-----------

Manage image namespace(s).

.. code:: xml

   <profiles>
     <profile name="name" description="text"/>
   </profiles>

The optional profiles section lets you maintain one image description
while allowing for variation of other sections that are included. A
separate profile element must be specified for each variation. The
profile child element, which has name and description attributes,
specifies an alias name used to mark sections as belonging to a profile,
and a short description explaining what this profile does.

For example to mark a set of packages as belonging to a profile, simply
annotate them with the profiles attribute as shown below:

.. code:: xml

   <packages type="image" profiles="profile_name">
     <package name="name"/>
   </packages>

It is also possible to mark sections as belonging to multiple profiles
by separating the names in the profiles attribute with a comma:

.. code:: xml

   <packages type="image" profiles="profile_A,profile_B">
     <package name="name"/>
   </packages>

If a section tag does not have a profiles attribute, it is globally
present in the configuration. If global sections and profiled sections
contains the same sub-sections, the profiled sections will overwrite
the global sections in the order of the provided profiles. For a better
overview of the result configuration when profiles are used we
recommend to put data that applies in any case to non profiled (global)
sections and only extend those global sections with profiled data.
For example:

.. code:: xml

   <preferences>
     <version>1.2.3</version>
     <packagemanager name="zypper"/>
   </preferences>

   <preferences profiles="oem_qcow_format">
     <type image="oem" filesystem="ext4" format="qcow2"/>
   </preferences>

   <preferences profiles="oem_vmdk_format">
     <type image="oem" filesystem="ext4" format="vmdk"/>
   </preferences>

The above example configures two version of the same oem type.
One builds a disk in qcow2 format the other builds a disk in
vmdk format. The global preferences section without a profile
assigned will be used in any case and defines those preferences
settings that are common to any build process. A user can
select both profiles at a time but that will result in building
the disk format that is specified last because one is overwriting
the other.

Use of one or more profile(s) during image generation is triggered
by the use of the ``--profile`` command line argument. multiple profiles
can be selected by passing this option multiple times.
