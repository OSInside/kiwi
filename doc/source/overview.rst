Conceptual Overview
-------------------

A system image (usually called "image"), is a *complete installation* of a Linux
system within a file. The image represents an operation system and,
optionally, contains the "final" configuration.

{kiwi} creates images in a two step process:

1. The first step, the *prepare operation*, generates a so-called
   *unpacked image tree* (directory) using the information provided in
   the image description.

2. The second step, the *create operation*, creates the *packed image* or
   *image* in the specified format based on the unpacked image and the
   information provided in the configuration file.

The image creation process with {kiwi} is automated and does not require any
user interaction. The information required for the image creation process is
provided by the image description.


Terminology
-----------

Appliance
   An appliance is a ready to use image of an operating system
   including a pre-configured application for a specific use case.
   The appliance is provided as an image file and needs to be
   deployed to, or activated in the target system or service.

Image
   The result of a {kiwi} build process.

Image Description
   Specification to define an appliance. The image description is a
   collection of human readable files in a directory. At least one XML
   file :file:`config.xml` or :file:`.kiwi` is required. In addition
   there may be as well other files like scripts or configuration data.
   These can be used to customize certain parts either of the {kiwi}
   build process or of the initial start-up behavior of the image.

Overlay Files
   A directory structure with files and subdirectories stored as part
   of the Image Description. This directory structure is packaged as
   a file :file:`root.tar.gz` or stored inside a directory named
   :file:`root`. Additional overlay directories for selected profiles
   are supported too and are taken into account if the directory
   name matches the name of the profile. The content of each of the
   directory structures is copied on top of the the existing file
   system (overlayed) of the appliance root. This also includes
   permissions and attributes as a supplement.

{kiwi}
   An OS appliance builder.

Virtualization Technology
   Software simulated computer hardware. A virtual machine acts like
   a real computer, but is separated from the physical hardware.
   Within this documentation the QEMU virtualization system is
   used. Another popular alternative is Virtualbox.

System Requirements
-------------------

To use and run {kiwi}, you need:

* A recent Linux distribution, see :ref:`supported-distributions` for
  details.

* Enough free disk space to build and store the image. We recommend a
  minimum of 15GB.

* Python version 3.5 or higher

* Git (package ``git``) to clone a repository.

* Any virtualization technology to start the image. We recommend QEMU.
