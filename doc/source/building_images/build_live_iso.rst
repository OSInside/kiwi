Build an ISO Hybrid Live Image
==============================

.. sidebar:: Abstract

   This page explains how to build a live image. It contains:

   * how to build an ISO image
   * how to run it with QEMU

A Live ISO image is a system on a removable media, e.g CD/DVD or USB stick.
Once built and deployed it boots off from this media without interfering
with other system storage components making it a useful pocket system for
testing and demo- and debugging-purposes.

To add a live ISO build to your appliance, create a `type` element with
`image` set to `iso` in your :file:`config.xml` as shown below:

.. code:: xml

   <image schemaversion="6.9" name="JeOS-Tumbleweed">
     <!-- snip -->
     <preferences>
       <type image="iso" primary="true" flags="overlay" hybridpersistent_filesystem="ext4" hybridpersistent="true"/>
       <!-- additional preferences -->
     </preferences>
     <!-- snip -->
   </image>

The following attributes of the `type` element are relevant when building
live ISO images:

- `flags`: Specifies the live ISO technology and dracut module to use, can
  be set to `overlay` or to `dmsquash`.

  If set to `overlay`, the kiwi-live dracut module will be used to support a
  live ISO system based on squashfs and overlayfs.
  If set to `dmsquash`, the dracut standard dmsquash-live module will be
  used to support a live ISO system based on squashfs and the device
  mapper. Note, both modules support a different set of live features.
  For details see :ref:`live_features`

- `hybridpersistent`: Accepts `true` or `false`, if set to `true` then the
  resulting image will be created with a COW file to keep data persistent
  over a reboot

- `hybridpersistent_filesystem`: The filesystem used for the COW
  file. Possible values are `ext4` or `xfs`, with `ext4` being the default.


With the appropriate settings present in :file:`config.xml` {kiwi} can now
build the image:

.. code:: bash

   $ sudo kiwi-ng --type iso system build \
         --description kiwi-descriptions/suse/x86_64/{exc_description} \
         --target-dir /tmp/myimage

The resulting image is saved in the folder :file:`/tmp/myimage` and can
be tested with QEMU:

.. code:: bash

   $ qemu -cdrom {exc_image_base_name}.x86_64-{exc_image_version}.iso -m 4096

The image is now complete and ready to use. See :ref:`iso_to_usb_stick` and
:ref:`iso_as_file_to_usb_stick` for further information concerning
deployment.

.. _live_features:

Decision for a live ISO technology
----------------------------------

The decision for the `overlay` vs. `dmsquash` dracut module depends on
the features one wants to use. From a design perspective the `overlay`
module is conceived for live ISO deployments on disk devices which
allows the creation of a write partition or cow file. The `dmsquash`
module is conceived as a generic mapping technology using device-mapper
snapshots. The following list describes important live ISO features and
their support status compared to the `overlay` and `dmsquash` modules.

ISO scan
  Usable in the same way with both dracut modules. This feature allows
  to boot the live ISO as a file from a grub loopback configured bootloader.
  The `live-grub-stick` tool is just one example that uses this feature.
  For details how to setup ISO scan with the `overlay` module see
  :ref:`iso_as_file_to_usb_stick`

ISO in RAM completely
  Usable with the `dmsquash` module through `rd.live.ram`. The `overlay`
  module does not support this mode but {kiwi} supports RAM only systems
  as OEM deployment into RAM from an install ISO media. For details how
  to setup RAM only deployments in {kiwi} see: :ref:`ramdisk_deployment`

Overlay based on overlayfs
  Usable with the `overlay` module. A squashfs compressed readonly root
  gets overlayed with a readwrite filesystem using the kernel overlayfs
  filesystem.

Overlay based on device mapper snapshots
  Usable with the `dmsquash` module. A squashfs compressed readonly root
  gets overlayed with a readwrite filesystem using a device mapper
  snapshot. This method was the preferred one before overlayfs existed
  in the Linux kernel.

Media Checksum Verification
  Boot the live iso only for ISO checksum verification. This is possible
  with both modules but the `overlay` module uses the `checkmedia` tool
  whereas the upstream `dmsquash` module uses `checkisomd5`. The activation
  of the verification process is done by passing the kernel option
  `mediacheck` for the `overlay` module and `rd.live.check` for
  the `dmsquash` module.

Live ISO through PXE boot
  Boot the live image via the network. This is possible with both
  modules but uses different technologies. The `overlay` module supports
  network boot only in combination with the AoE (Ata Over Ethernet) protocol.
  For details see :ref:`network_live_boot`. The `dmsquash` module supports
  network boot by fetching the ISO image into memory from `root=live:<url>`
  using the `livenet` module.

Persistent Data
  Keep new data persistent on a writable storage device. This can be done
  with both modules but in different ways. The `overlay` module activates
  persistency with the kernel boot parameter `rd.live.overlay.persistent`.
  If the persistent setup cannot be created the fallback to the non persistent
  mode applies automatically. The `overlay` module auto detects if it is
  used on a disk or ISO scan loop booted from a file. If booted as disk,
  persistency is setup on a new partition of that disk. If loop booted
  from file, persistency is setup on a new cow file. The cow file/partition
  setup can be influenced with the kernel boot parameters:
  `rd.live.overlay.cowfs` and `rd.live.cowfile.mbsize`. The `dmsquash`
  module configures persistency through the `rd.live.overlay` option
  exclusively and does not support the automatic creation of a write
  partition in disk mode.

.. admonition:: dmsquash documentation

   Documentation for the upstream `dmsquash` module can be found
   `here <http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/dracut.cmdline.7.html>`_.
   Options to setup `dmsquash` are marked with `rd.live`
